Declaring a variable :
    - const 1 = 1;
        - usually means variable will not change at all
    
    - let two = 2;
    - two = 'two';
    
    var three= 'III'
    
- if a variable is decalred inside a function it is only local
- if a variable is declared outside of a function is applies to whole thing
